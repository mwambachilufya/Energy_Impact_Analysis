# Energy_Impact_Analysis
Data Analytics project that investigates the effect of energy consumption by the mines on the Copper mining operations in Zambia from 2014 to 2024
# Key Findings

- **Weak Negative Correlation**: Only 9.19% of variance in copper production is explained by electricity consumption. With a correlation coefficient of -0.303210035.
- Whereas it is the expectation that the more copper Zambia produces the more electricity is consumed for such operational processes this analysis seems to suggest otherwise. Significantly, in 2024 when Zambia was experiencing an energy crisis due to drought, electricity consumption by the mining sector was at 4650 GWh( the lowest in a 10 year period) but copper production was at 820,000 tonnes the second best it has been over an eleven year period where the best production was in 2020 at 828,000 tonnes. This relationship is quite common across this time period.
# Contents of this project

- `Energy impact project.xlsx` - original data including yearly production, consumption, rainfall, and temperature.
- `Dashboard.twb` - Interactive Tableau dashboard
- `dashboard screenshot.png` -  a screenshot of the Dashboard visualization
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Tools used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, Z-score calculations
- **Tableau Public**: Creating the dashboard.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Z-Score Analysis 
- Visualizes the Z scores of Copper production and electricity consumption.
- The Z score for electricity consumption is represented by the orange line and the Z score for copper production by the blue line.
- What immediately stands out is the obvious outlier which is the year 2024 where the score for electricity consumption is significantly lower than average. Meaning the mines consumed less electricity generated by the Energy regulation board. This could be because there was below average generation that may have been brought about by the drought.
- Another interesting relationship to note is in 2023 electicity consumption was way above average, the highest its been across the 10 years yet production was below average. this confirms the weak correlation there is between these two variables and how much more other factors play a bigger role in Copper production in Zambia.

### 2. Scatter Plot with Regression
- Shows  the relationship between electricity consumption and copper production
- shows a weak negative trend line (r = -0.303)
- shows the lack of strong linear relationship meaning electricity consumption is not a very significant factor in determining how much copper is produced.

### 3. Trend Analysis
- Moving averages smooth out the volatile year on year changes the green line represents this
- the red line shows the actual trends in copper production as can be seen it is very volatile.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Data was collected from publicly available annual reports. reports from Bank of Zambia provided the annual copper produced for each year and annual reports from ERB provided the electricity consumption for each sector of the country including mining over the 10 year period.  
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation, range calculations
3. **Trend Analysis**: Year-on-year growth rates and CAGR
4. **Standardization**: Z-score calculations to identify outliers and efficiency patterns
5. **Regression Analysis**: Linear regression to quantify relationship strength
6. **Visualization**: Multi-chart dashboard for comprehensive insight communication

## Insights & Recommendations

The weak correlation indicates that **electricity consumption is not a primary driver** of copper production levels. In fact it may go so far as say when consumption is least production is best. This however means that when consumption is high and production is low it may mean th efficiency of operations at the mine may not be that good and this must be looked into by both the mines and energy regulaation board so that to ensure that mines do not overspend on energy that in the end will not lead to anythiing productive and on the side the energy regulation board can ensure that the generation being sent out if it is in excess can be diverted to other sectors of the economy. It is something worth investigating for both parties.
